C++ is the most used language 
Fast code, Direct control over the hardware

Native Languate:
	Code -> Compiler -> MACHINE CODE 
		
	Other language run on a virtual machine.

	A virtual machine is like a translator

	CPP is a native language, no need of translation for the machine

	Code is native doesn't mean the code is fast. Bad CPP can be slower than Java or other languages

Can run in any platform:
	You just need a compiler to output the machine code specific to a target machine.
	Example: A compiler can take c++ code and output a machine code for x64 or x32
	Windows, Mac, Linux, Mobile Apps, Consoles like XBox ...
	Great when you target a wide range of platform
	
C++ is popular, you will have tons of resources to learn and develop.
